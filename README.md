# Music Mentor Bot

A Facebook Messenger chatbot that interacts with users to help them learn music theory. So far, it supports a menu system that shows users the different scales in music. The scales supported in this app so far include major, minor, major pentatonic, and minor pentatonic scales. It also include a rudimentary chat system that includes responding to user greetings, sharing tidbits about music, and even telling a few  jokes and stories about music!    
This project is still in development.
